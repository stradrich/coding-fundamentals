The code Array.from({length: 24}, (_, i) => i < 10 ? 0${i}:00:${i}:00) creates an array of 24 strings, where each string represents a 1-hour time value in 24-hour format.

The Array.from() method creates a new array from an array-like or iterable object. In this case, it creates an array with a length of 24.

The second argument to Array.from() is a map function that is used to map each element of the new array. The map function takes two arguments: the value of the element (which is ignored in this case and replaced with the _ placeholder), and the index of the element (which is used to generate the time value).

The map function uses a ternary operator to check if the index is less than 10. If it is, it adds a leading zero to the hour value and returns a string in the format hh:00. Otherwise, it returns a string in the format h:00. The resulting array is an array of strings representing the 24-hour time values.


 // print all the time slots with different days
    console.log('\t' + this.col.join('\t'));
    for (let i = 0; i < this.rows.length; i++) {
    console.log(`${this.rows[i]}\t${this.schedule[i].map((col) => col.length > 0 ? 'X' : '-').join('\t')}`);
  } 
  
This code prints a table of the schedule, where each cell represents a time slot for a day.

console.log('\t' + this.col.join('\t')); prints the header row of the table with all the time slots for each day. The \t is a tab character, which is used to separate the columns in the table. This line concatenates a tab character with each element of the col array using the join method, and adds a tab character at the beginning to align the column headers.

for (let i = 0; i < this.rows.length; i++) { starts a loop that iterates over each day of the week.

console.log(${this.rows[i]}\t${this.schedule[i].map((col) => col.length > 0 ? 'X' : '-').join('\t')}); prints a row of the table with the day name and the schedule for that day. This line uses string interpolation to combine the day name (this.rows[i]) and the schedule for that day.

${this.schedule[i].map((col) => col.length > 0 ? 'X' : '-').join('\t')} creates a string of the schedule for the current day. It uses the map method to transform each element of the schedule array for that day. If the element has a length greater than 0 (i.e. if there is at least one event scheduled for that time slot), it sets the value to 'X', otherwise it sets it to '-'. The join method then concatenates each element of the array using a tab character.
Therefore, the overall effect of the code is to print a table of the schedule, where each cell represents a time slot for a day. The header row shows all the time slots for each day, and each subsequent row shows the day name and the schedule for that day, with 'X' indicating scheduled events and '-' indicating empty time slots.

for (let i = 0; i < this.rows.length; i++) {
    const row = [];
    for (let j = 0; j < this.col.length; j++) {
      row.push('');
    }
    table.push(row);
  }

This code initializes a two-dimensional array (also known as a table) with empty strings in each cell. Here is a breakdown of what is happening:

The code begins by defining a loop that will iterate over the rows of the table.

for (let i = 0; i < this.rows.length; i++) {

Inside the loop, a new empty row array is created.

const row = [];

A nested loop is used to iterate over each column of the current row.

for (let j = 0; j < this.col.length; j++) {

Inside the nested loop, an empty string is added to the current row.

row.push('');

Once all columns have been processed for the current row, the completed row is added to the table.

table.push(row);

The outer loop repeats until all rows have been processed, resulting in a table with the specified number of rows and columns, where each cell contains an empty string.

Overall, this code is creating a blank table, where all cells are empty strings, which can be populated with data later on.

Now, each row is an array that contains an array for each hour of the day. You can access a particular event by indexing into the row, then the hour, and finally the event itself. For example, to access the event at Sunday 1:00 pm, you would use this.schedule[0][13][0].

You can access the array that represents Monday at 1:00 pm (13:00) using this.schedule[1][13]. To access the first item in the array, you can add another [0] at the end: this.schedule[1][13][0]. This will give you the first item of the array that represents any events scheduled at 1:00 pm on Monday.

      console.log(this.myCalendarApp) // console.log(myCalendarApp.schedule); 2D data structure

      // STEP 3: ADD NEW EVENT
      case this.i + 1:
      let newEventInput = prompt(`How would you like use your time slot? 
                            (i.g) access: Sunday, 12am would be [0][0][0],
                                          Monday, 1pm would be [1][13][0]`) 
                                          // [Day: Sunday = 0, Monday = 1 ... so on], [Time: 0-23], [Event(s)]
                                          // The input expected by the prompt is in the format of [Day][Time][Event(s)], where [Day] is an integer between 0 and 6 representing the day of the week (0 being Sunday, 1 being Monday, etc.), [Time] is an integer between 0 and 23 representing the hour of the day, and [Event(s)] is a string describing what the user wants to use the time slot for.

      let dayTimeEeventpart = newEventInput.split['['] // split the input string into an array of parts using '[' as the delimiter
      let days = parseInt(dayTimeEeventpart[1]) // extract the day value from the second element of the array
      let time = parseInt(dayTimeEeventpart[2]) // extract the time value from the third element of the array
      let events = dayTimeEeventpart[3].substring(0, dayTimeEeventpart[3].length - 1) // extract the event description from the fourth element of the array, removing the closing bracket at the end

      this.schedule[days][hours].push(newEventInput); 

  dayTimeEventParts is an array that contains three elements, where each element represents one part of the input string in the format [day][time][event].

The third element of dayTimeEventParts is the event part, which includes the event description and the closing square bracket. For example, if the user entered [0][12][meeting], then the third element would be meeting].

The purpose of substring(0, dayTimeEventParts[3].length - 1) is to extract the event description without the closing square bracket. Here's what's happening:

dayTimeEventParts[3].length returns the length of the event part, which includes the event description and the closing square bracket. For example, if the user entered [0][12][meeting], then dayTimeEventParts[3].length would be 8.
dayTimeEventParts[3].length - 1 subtracts 1 from the length to get the index of the last character of the event description. For example, if the user entered [0][12][meeting], then dayTimeEventParts[3].length - 1 would be 7.
Finally, substring(0, dayTimeEventParts[3].length - 1) extracts a substring of the event part that starts at index 0 (the beginning of the string) and ends at index dayTimeEventParts[3].length - 1 (the last character of the event description). In the example of [0][12][meeting], this would extract the substring meeting.
