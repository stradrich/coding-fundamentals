1. Why do we need a loop? How do you write a basic for loop?

ðŸŒ¾  To sort whether certain condition(s) has and hans't been met, the loop enable us to be more efficient 
    in reducing long lines of codes. 

    There are a few commonly used loops in JavaScript;
    (a). for loops
    (b). for in loop
    (c). for of
    (d). while 

    The syntax for (a). for loops goes like this:

    // As long as the condition is true, checking will run, otherwise the loop should stop
    for (let i = 0; i < something; i++) {
        // whatever necessary goes inside here
    }


2. Difference between console.log() and return?

ðŸŒ¾  console.log() prints whatever arguments into the console, only when it truly exists and properly defined, else we get nothing or error messages.
    return is used to return specific values from a function

3. What are truthy values? What are falsy values?

ðŸŒ¾ These are Boolean expression. The falsy value throws null, undefined, false, NaN, etc. The truthy values return expected results.

    we could use traceroute, you'll notice that your packets must travel through many things to get to their destination, the list of names could be very long and definitely giving me eye sore...

5. How does a website work? What files are involved?
